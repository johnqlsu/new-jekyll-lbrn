Other than skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men. Researchers do not know exactly what causes prostate cancer but, on a basic level, prostate cancer is caused by changes in the DNA of a normal prostate cell. Although new treatments for prostate cancer continue to be investigated, no definitive cure has been found yet for the advanced aggressive stages. Resveratrol (RES, trans-3,5,4' -trihydroxystilbene), a well-known natural polyphenolic phytoalexin present abundantly in red wine and other plants, is a component of Asian traditional medicine used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Recently, RES has gained considerable attention as an anticancer agent since a report was published by Jang and coworkers in 1997. Its potential use in chemoprevention and chemotherapy for various cancer forms relies on its effects on cell growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cancer metastasis. As RES appears to have many anti-tumor effects on different cancer cell types, the molecular basis of these effects needs to be extensively studied using a cell culture model that best resembles the tumor environment in the body. This will allow us to better understand its mechanism of action and its potential use as a coadjuvant drug for established cancer treatments. Our first goal is to investigate the dose-response effect of RES on the morphology (apoptosis and differentiation) of prostate cancer cells cultured as spheroids (30 cultures) . The second goal is to investigate the molecular mechanism of RES action by repeating the above treatments and performing transcriptome and proteomic analyses on treated versus control spheroids. Proteomic analyses will be performed using commercial antibody microarrays. The RNA sequencing and proteomic results will be validated by quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively . The long term goal is to investigate themolecular mechanism of RES action on 30 cancer cell cultures and to identify the main Cell Signaling pathways activated by this flavonoid compound.

PCP is one of the most heavily used organochlorine pesticides in the U.S. preceded by the herbicides atrazine, and alachlor. Noticeable interest is drawn to PCP for its ability to induce systemic toxicity and carcinogenesis . This proposal focuses on the toxicity of PCP to the extent that it may alter gene expressions in hepatocyte culture.

Patients commonly present with spasticity in the lower limbs, as the longest nerve fibers appear to be the earliest affected. Patients with the complicated form of HSP may also present with retinopathy, ataxia, peripheral polyneuropathy, and cognitive deficit. To date, 57 distinct chromosomal HSP loci have been identified through genetic linkage analysis of affected families. Of particular interest to this study is the finding that an autosomal dominant form of HSP (AD-HSP) is caused by mutations in the Kif5A gene, a kinesin transport motor enriched in neurons. In addition, approximately 10% of the known cases of complicated HSP are due to mutations in Kif5A. Clinical treatment for HSP is presently limited to symptomatic reduction of muscle spasticity. While this can be effective for short periods, progressive axonal degeneration leads to poor long-term prognoses. As a result, there is a need for a more mechanistic understanding of the primary causes of HSPs. This proposal is targeted at broadening our understanding of the physiological manifestation of AD-HSP-causing mutations in Kif5A. With this goal in mind, we will pursue two lines of experimentation. First, we will continue our in vitro studies to measure the altered catalytic and mechanical properties of Kif5A with AD-HSP-causing mutations. Second, we will identify Kif5A cargoes in neurons and examine the kinetics of cargo transport in vivo in the presence of wild-type and mutant Kif5A. Our long-term goal is a mechanistic understanding of how mutations in the Kif5A gene alter its normal cellular functions so that ultimately therapies can be designed to treat the fundamental cause of AD- HSP, rather than attempting to treat the physiological manifestation of the underlying dysfunction. In addition, the centrality of kinesin-dependent transport in a host of cellular functions gives the opportunity for outcomes of this study to have far-reaching potential in therapies for other human disorders.

The two known incretins are glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Both incretins are rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The GLP agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are drugs that augment the incretin system representing a novel class of anti-hyperglycemic agents which also have been shown to elicit pleotropic effects such as improvement of hepatic inflammation and hepatosteatosis, insulin resistance, help cardiac health, weight loss and induce satiety. Hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) are among the widely documented risk factors for the development and progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Homocysteine (Hcy), an intermediate in the metabolism of the essential amino acid methionine (Met) has been implicated in various age related pathologies such as heart disease, Alzheimers disease, osteoporosis, stroke, and end stage renal disease. Hyperhomocysteinemia can result from deficiencies of vitamins like folate, B6 and B12 or enzyme defects (Met metabolizing) or dietary excess of Met. High serum Cholesterol (Chol) or hypercholesterolemia that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis is also considered to be caused due to inflammatory processes. Among others, increased levels of Chol are known to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, exaggerate the pressor response to stress and contribute to blood pressure increase. Interestingly, both Met and Chol are rich in meat and dairy based products (extensively consumed in US and components of staple diet), and are invariably consumed together. Therefore, studying the effects of a dietary combination of Met and Chol is very important especially in the context of nutrition and atherosclerosis. The DPP4 inhibitors reduce post-prandial glycemia via inhibition of the degradation of GLP-1. In addition to their antidiabetic action, DPP-4 inhibitors have pleiotropic cardiovascular protective effects. Feeding rats with diets rich in L-Met and Chol, we will test the hypothesis Hyperhomocysteinemia in high Cholesterol fed rats potentiates development of atherosclerosis, and can be alleviated by DPP4 inhibitors' with two specific aims; a) To determine the effects of feeding a dietary excess of Cholesterol and Methionine on the vascular (aorta) structural/atherosclerotic changes; and b) To evaluate if treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin alleviates inflammation and the atherosclerotic processes, and study the mechanistic aspects involved. Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rats weighing between 250-275g will be fed i) normal feed (without any enrichment), ii) a diet enriched with 1% L-methionine, iii) a diet enriched with 2% Chol, and iv) a diet enriched with 1% L-Met and 2% Chol. Each group will comprise of 10 rats on the respective dietary regimen and the feeding will be carried out for a period of 5 weeks. A similar protocol will be followed with 4 additional groups of 10 rats each, and administered an aqueous suspension of sitagliptin (300 mg/kg/d) by oral gavage from day 15 till the end of the experiment. The overall goals of this proposal are to evaluate the effects of manipulating the dietary content of Met and Chol and identify key events involved in the interplay of risk factors responsible for the development of cardiovascular pathology. An additional goal is to determine if treatment with sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, ameliorates the development of these risk factors, and understand the mechanistic aspects. These studies will yield useful information in understanding the development of vascular complications during the combined consumption of Met and Chol (rich in Western diets), and if DPP4 inhibitors help in recession of problems and for better patient management.

Metronidazole has been the drug choice for treating the disease, however adverse side effects and the development of drug resistance strains have necessitated the search for new drugs. Preliminary observations have indicated that Giardia mRNAs have very short 5’UTRs and that translation initiation in Giardia occurs via direct ribosome binding, without the elaborate transcript scanning process that is typical in higher eukaryotes. In yeast and mammals, translation initiation factor eIF4G forms a trimeric complex eIF4F by binding with two other proteins, a 5’ cap-binding protein eIF4E and a ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A and eIF4G is a key player in binding pre- initiation complexes to 5’end of mRNA. However, homology based searches of Giardia genome database have identified eIF4E and eIF4A homologs but failed to identify a homolog for eIF4G. It is not clear as to how pre-initiation complexes are recruited to the mRNA in the absence of a key initiation factor eIF4G. Since, GleIF4E2, a cap-binding homolog of eIF4E, binds in close proximity to the initiation codon, it is hypothesized that GleIF4E2 interacts with the components of the pre-initiation complex and facilitates direct binding of the pre-initiation complex to initiation codon. We will use two complementary approaches to identify the GleIF4E2 interacting proteins in the pre-initiaition complex. The proteins will be purified by these two approaches will be identified by mass spectrometry. The interaction of GleIF4E2 with identified proteins will be validated by co-immunoprecipitation, GST-pull down assays and yeast-two hybrid analysis. Characterizing the GleIF4E2 interacting proteins will help us understand the process of translation initiation in Giardia. Although scanning mechanism is absent in Giardia, presence of eIF4A homolog GleIF4A in Giardia suggests that it has a role in translation initiation. We will investigate the role of GleIF4A in translation by knocking down the gene expression and using eIF4A inhibitors hippuristionl and pateamine A.

Anticancer agents that target DNA are generally the most effective agents in clinical use and have produced significant increases in the survival of cancer patients, but they are extremely toxic. Also, some of the bacterial species are becoming resistant to most of the traditional antibiotics. Consequently, much effort has been put into finding robust inhibitors that are more selective, less toxic and less susceptible to drug resistance. Havi ng experience in the field of heterocyclic synthesis and medicinal chemistry, we recently obtained some interesti ng preliminary results on anticancer activity of our Ru-pyrazole complexes from NCI-screening. (vide infra) The results indicate that some of our compounds exhibit anticancer activity, mainly towards non small cell J ung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Currentl y we are planning on synthesizing new set of pyrazoles with different substitution patterns and their metal complexes, and screen them for anticancer activity. In parallel to the anticancer activity studies. we have also tested set of substituted quinolines for anti bacterial activity and they found to have considerable inhibition effect on the growth of the E. coli. Based on these preliminary results and the biological significance of pyrazole pharmacophore, we envisage that combining both pyrazole and quinoline moieties together may increase the therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we plan to develop a library of novel quinoline-pyrazole bis-heterocycles and evaluate their antibacterial activities . The general aim of our overall project is to design and synthesize nitrogen heterocycles and their metal complexes to evaluate for anticancer and antibacterial activities. These are mainly two independent goals, but they can be accomplished by complimentary approaches because of the common synthetic ground. The long term goal of this project is to find novel anticancer agents for lung cancer treatment and antibiotics that are less susceptible to drug resistance with the main focus on MRSA strains. In addition to that, we will be developing several synthetic approaches that wi ll u ltimately provide new chemica l tools for the diverse range of synthetic chemists and biomedical resea rchers in academia and industry.

It is predicted to become the third leading cause of death in the U.S. by 2020. The advancement of this disease is not fully reversible. Among others, exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) leads to abnormal inflammatory responses in the lungs. Second-hand cigarette smoke (SHS) exposure is considered to be a risk factor associated with increased carriage of respiratory pathogens and frequent airway infections. Generally, such association is ascribed to immunomodulatory and irritant effects of the components of CS (in human cells). The toxic response can be individual or in combination with other agents, including among others bacteria. Epidemiological evidence has shown that nontypeable-Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common forms of bacteria that colonize in the COPD airway. These agents and other inhaled particles are effectively eliminated by alveolar macrophages and airway and lung epithelial cells which sense them. Interestingly, secondhand smoke exposure activates these cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes, thereby providing a cellular mechanism that links smoking with inflammation and tissue damage. During COPD these cells are exposed either frequent or prolonged periods of time to a host of inflammatory mediators and effector molecules from inflammatory cells. Impairments in innate lung responses in patients with COPD mediate exacerbations by enabling bacteria to proliferate and persist in the airways. Persistence of bacteria leads to chronic airway inflammation, which is enhanced during invasion by incoming bacterial pathogens. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic approaches that lead to rapid and successful elimination of pathogenic bacteria from COPD airways, and reduce the mortality rate of COPD (high) are urgently needed.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US (www.cdc.gov). Of all major types of cancer, pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate. It ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US (www.cancer.gov) and is predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2020 (http://www.pancan.org/). Pancreatic cancer has poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early. It is one of the few cancers for which survival has not improved substantially over nearly 40 years. (http://www.pancreatic.org/). For all stages of pancreatic cancer, the 1- and 5-year relative survival rates are 27% and 6%, respectively (Cancer Facts &amp;amp; Figures 2014). Furthermore, treatment options for pancreatic cancer are limited. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy may extend survival but they seldom produce a cure. The tumor response rates of gemcitabine (Gemzar�), the first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is approximately 10%. Recently a combination therapy with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane�) and gemcitabine was approved for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. While promising, substantial toxic effects and modest benefits were observed with this combination. Therefore, there is a need for newer treatments with fewer side effects and marked enhancement in activity over existing therapies. Our long-term goal is to develop an efficacious approach to improve cancer chemotherapy and to overcome cancer chemoresistance. Our overall objective in the present application is to develop a novel strategy to enhance the efficacy of gemcitabine against pancreatic tumors cells by augmenting the TOCOSOLR paclitaxel nanoemulsion with the tocotrienol isomers of vitamin E and by conjugating gemcitabine and paclitaxel to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Our central hypothesis is that nanoemulsions made with tocotrienols as the lipid core and loaded with PUFA conjugated paclitaxel and gemcitabine will have significantly higher anticancer activity than the free paclitaxel + free gemcitabine combination therapy.
