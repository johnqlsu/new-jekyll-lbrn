        <p>Researchers at Louisiana Tech have recently developed several new bio- and tissue engineered technologies. Dr.David Mills' lab has developed a manufacturing method for fabricating drug-doped customized thermoplastic filaments that are bioactive and can be produced at low cost. This method is not constrained to one particular material, but is capable of being easily modified to encompass metal particles, ceramic nanotubes, and bioactive powders that retain integrity and functionality through the 3D printing process. The advantage of such a process is the level of customization achievable by the designer allowing fabrication of the desired material characteristics without complex modification. Dr. Mills this approach believe this approach will open many new clinical treatments enhance dental and orthopedic implant integration and longevity promising an increase in the quality of life for many patients.</p>
